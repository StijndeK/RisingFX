# RFX
 
RFX is a synthesiser optimised for creating transitional moving effects such as whooshes, risers and stingers. I find there to be a lack of a intuitive synthesisers optimalised for creating these effects, which is why I started developing Transition FX. The user should be able to create the entire sound from within the synthesiser, without any automation and external effects.

TFX is written in C++ using the JUCE framework and Maximilian DSP library. It is a refactor of the [TransitionFX ALPHA](https://github.com/StijndeK/TransitionFX-ALPHA), made for [Code With Friends Fall 2020](https://codewithfriends.io/events/cwf-fall-2020/).
